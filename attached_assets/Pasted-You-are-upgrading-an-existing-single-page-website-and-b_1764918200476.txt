You are upgrading an existing single-page website and booking console for
“The Quarterdeck – Sports & Recreation Complex”
into a complete full-stack web application.

I will upload the current index.html (Tailwind + inline React/Babel).
This file contains the entire landing page and the full booking console.
Your job is NOT to redesign it.
Your job is to rebuild it properly as a React + Node.js + PostgreSQL system.

Very important rule: Do NOT change the design, spacing, layout, Tailwind classes, animations, or UI behavior.
Everything must look and function exactly like the existing file.

PROJECT STRUCTURE & TECHNOLOGY

Create a monorepo with these folders:

/server → Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Prisma or Knex
/client → React + Vite + Tailwind (compiled via PostCSS)

Tailwind must NOT use CDN.
Inline <script type="text/babel"> must be removed and replaced with real React components.

Root package.json scripts:

dev – run server + client concurrently
dev:server – backend only
dev:client – frontend only

FRONTEND: MIGRATE THE EXISTING HTML TO REACT

Take the uploaded index.html and convert it into React components:

Landing Page Components:
Navbar
Hero Section
Facilities Overview
Construction Updates
Gallery
Membership Tiers
Rules & Safety
Careers
Contact
Footer

Booking Console Components:
/client/src/components/Booking/*
All UI from the embedded React app must be copied as-is into real components.

Use React Router with routes for:
/
/booking
/events
/leaderboard
/rules
/careers
/contact
/facility/:slug
/profile
/login
/register

Do not alter the design.
All Tailwind classes must be copied exactly.

BOOKING CONSOLE – MUST BE IDENTICAL

The booking console inside the uploaded file includes advanced logic.
All of it must be preserved:

Facility selection
Venue selector
Court/Resource selector
60/90/120 minute durations
Time-slot grid
Off-peak discount logic
Matchmaking toggle
Coach booking toggle
Add-ons with multi-quantity (+ / –)
Payer selection: Self or Another Member
Membership number validation
Air Rifle Certification modal
Liability Waiver modal
Booking summary and total calculation
Bookings list
Leaderboard view
Events & Academies view
Profile view

No redesign, no simplification, no removal of functionality.

REMOVE ALL MOCK DATA & CONTENTFUL

The uploaded HTML contains mock data (MOCK_USER, MOCK_EVENTS, MOCK_MEMBERSHIP_NUMBERS, etc.)
It also contains Contentful CMS integration at the bottom.

This must be removed completely.

Replace all mock logic with real backend API calls.

BACKEND – DATA MODELS (POSTGRESQL)

Implement the following models using Prisma or Knex:

USER
id, fullName, email, phone, passwordHash
role: USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN
createdAt, updatedAt

MEMBERSHIP
id, userId, membershipNumber (e.g., QD-0001)
tier, validFrom, validTo, status

FACILITY
id, name, slug, basePrice, minPlayers, requiresCertification

BOOKING
id, userId, venue, facilityId, resourceId
date, startTime, endTime, durationMinutes
status: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED
paymentMethod
payerType (self / member)
payerMembershipNumber
totalPrice
createdAt, updatedAt

BOOKING ADD-ONS
id, bookingId, addOnId, label, quantity, pricePerUnit

EVENT / ACADEMY
id, title, description, facilityId, scheduleDateTime
coach, price, capacity, type (Event/Class/Academy), slug, image

LEADERBOARD
userId, facilityId, score, wins, losses, rankingPoints

BACKEND – API ENDPOINTS

AUTH
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh

FACILITIES
GET /api/facilities

MEMBERSHIP VALIDATION
GET /api/memberships/validate?number=QD-0001

BOOKINGS
GET /api/bookings/me
POST /api/bookings

BOOKING RULES:
Prevent double booking using database transactions.
Server must revalidate all pricing: duration × rate, off-peak discount, add-on totals, quantities.

ADMIN (role restricted)
User management
Membership management
Event CRUD
Leaderboard score updates
Booking override/cancel/block

CMS REQUIREMENTS

Build a simple CMS layer (Express admin or Strapi-like) allowing admins to manage:

Homepage content
Facilities content
Membership tiers
Rules & policies
Announcements & news
Gallery images
Careers page content
Contact information

All CMS content must be accessible to the React frontend via API.

AUTHENTICATION

Implement secure authentication:

JWT access token
HttpOnly refresh token
Password hashing with bcrypt or argon2

Frontend must include:
Login
Register
Session persistence
Show logged-in user’s name and membership tier in the booking header

SEED DATA

Create initial seeds for:

Facilities
Memberships QD-0001–QD-0005
Demo users
Demo leaderboard scores
Demo events

PAYMENTS (Phase 2 only)

Do not build online payments yet.
Backend must be architected so Stripe or PayFast can be added later.

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

Use .env for all secrets.
Configure CORS.
Express must serve the Vite production build.
"npm run dev" should start both apps concurrently.
