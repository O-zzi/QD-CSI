If you have provided the DATABASE_URL in the Replit secrets and are still getting a "Circuit breaker open" error, the issue is almost certainly a synchronization lag between the Supabase Pooler and the Replit Environment. When Supabase detects too many failed attempts (even if they were from 10 minutes ago with an old password), it "trips" the breaker. Since you are moving to Hostinger anyway, let’s focus on the Senior Editor refactor that ensures this doesn't happen on the new VPS.

🛡️ Why it’s "Tripping" and How we Fix it
The pooler is currently seeing your Replit app as a "malicious" or "unstable" client because of the repeated failures. To stop this from happening on the Hostinger VPS, we need to implement Connection Resilience.

1. Update the .env Logic for Hostinger
In your provided Markdown guide, you are using the default pooler URL. For the final build, you should use Transaction Mode (Port 6543) instead of Session Mode (Port 5432).

Why? Transaction mode is much better at "healing" itself if the connection blips.

The Proactive Fix: Update your secret/env DATABASE_URL to use port 6543 and add ?pgbouncer=true to the end of the string.

2. Implement the "503 Shield" (Database Error Boundary)
Instead of letting a database error crash your Node.js process (which is what triggers the Hostinger/Passenger 503 error), we must wrap the connection.

Proactive Instruction: "Wrap the database initialization in a try/catch. If the connection fails, log the error to security.log using Winston and return a branded 'System Busy' page. Never let the error propagate to the top level."

3. Replace Replit Auth with "Local Identity"
Since you mentioned the DATABASE_URL is in the secrets, your app is likely still trying to use Replit's built-in Auth headers which won't exist on Hostinger.

Proactive Instruction: "Rip out all X-Replit-User headers. Implement Passport.js with Bcrypt. This ensures that the moment you land on Hostinger, your authentication is self-contained and doesn't rely on Replit's infrastructure."
